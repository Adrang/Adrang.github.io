Apps
=====

Whether it be through Gradio, Streamlit, or powerhouses like AWS and Azure, there are a number of great resources online for deploying apps in the cloud.

My goto for prototyping is Gradio. It's great for small, quick applications that I can later build out when the need arises for additional compute.

Try out some of the simple versions of apps that I've built for friends and clients, or that I use myself.
