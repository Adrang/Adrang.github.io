# Tips

- Review the job description and mine through the REQUIRED skills. Ensure you have examples to back up those skills.
- Focus on your role, not what your teammates did.
- Structure in STAR/SOAR formatting
- Quantify when you can.
- Practice, as in delivery out loud. 
- Keep if succinct. Get to the "conclusion" first.

## Elevator Pitch

1. Keep your elevator speech under five minutes. Paint a picture of your career journey thus far for the recruiter and interviewer. Some of the best elevator speeches are the ones that bring the resume to life as a discussion document. Highlight key positions of responsibility or positions that enabled you to learn, grow and develop. Express any key milestones in certain jobs that help convey why you are the candidate to consider.
1. Your elevator speech may set you apart from other candidates. The clearer and more articulate you are in delivering who you are and why you want a certain position, may result in your name being placed at the top of the call back list for a second or third interview.
1. Leave the jargon for the team who interviews you. When speaking with the recruiter, it’s best to use general terms -- do the same when preparing your elevator speech too.
1. Sound interested and energized by the opportunity to interview. Don’t recite your elevator speech, so it doesn’t sound canned. Be fluid and dynamic in your communication style.

# End-of-Interview Questions

1. What's your favorite memory working here?
1. What is your favorite/recent project or feature you worked on within the company?
1. If I were to by hired, what would the next 6 months look like? What would a typical day look like? What would constitute "success"? How would you make use of my skill set?
1. What does it take to be a successful candidate?
   1. What are the top, let's say 5, skills and/or traits you would expect for a successful candidate?
1. What is the process for advocating for a new project or use case?
1. What avenues exist for both inter and intra-team communication? For instance, at IOMAXIS, we used a blend of email and Mattermost.
1. What data infrastructure is currently in place? How is data collected? How and where is it stored? Flat files? Databases? Relational? Non-relational?
1. My understanding is there is a fair amount of experience with machine learning already in the team, though it is not *the* skill of any given individual. That's largely where I will be stepping in. How is ML currently used in some projects? What resources exist for building and training models of various sizes?
1. What kind of restrictions are commonly enforced, or freedoms provided, in terms of setting up and maintaining a dev environment?
1. Along with opportunities for growth and learning, what opportunities are there for community outreach? What types of programs or events are currently in place?
1. How do you foresee the team growing over the course of the next 6 months to a year?
1. What forms of feedback are in place to let me see the impacts of my efforts on those I work with and the company as a whole?


# Saved Answers

1. Why are you interested in Imbue?

Imbue, as a company, appeals to me largely because of the problem it was set up to solve along with the way it aspires to get there. The big part being that computers are *tools* we use, and Imbue is trying to enhance the way we use those tools for practical purposes. My first masters was built on a similar goal -- exploring building a brain-controlled interface (BCI) for intuitive control of a computer. The issue I saw with both traditional methods of input (e.g. keyboard and mouse), along with other types of BCIs was the lack of intuition. People have to learn how to use them properly. Whereas movement, or even just the intent of such, is an intuitive reaction to one's desires. So, to me, the way we designed and built the current methods of control felt to be leaving *something* on the table, and I sought to explore ways of bridging that design gap.

Imbue is seeking to do a similar thing, but at a broader scale than control interfaces. And it is seeking to do this in a way using the very domain (AI) that inspired me towards computer science in the first place all those years ago. We share a vision about the future and practical purpose of intelligent computers, along with a path on how to reach such a goal. It is a future not about humans versus AI, where we worry about AI taking our jobs or passions. But it is about humans *with* AI, where we use intelligent systems to assist us in our day-to-day lives.

1. What specifically interests you about this role and what are your main motivations to excel in it? How might this opportunity align with your long-term career goals?

AI/ML is at a point where it is starting to grow beyond the narrow tasks, and while many strive towards GAI, just as many are too quick to jump over the necessary steps and building blocks to get there. This role looks to focus on those necessary steps, from the test tooling infrastructure to the visualizations. All the while, pushing the current state-of-the-art just a little bit further at every opportunity we can. 

Beyond the type of work reasons, this role in particular holds my interest due to the work and growth structure built into the role. In this field, we are always learning. It is a requirement both in passion and in keeping up. And that learning is most efficient not solely in isolation and from reading papers, but also with support and guidance from peers. There is, and always will be, an importance and necessity for being able to go out on your own and learn, but there is just as much a time to work as part of a team and be able to ask for help from those around you. This role allows for those learning and growth factors in the form of time and resource to self-guide your own learning, as well as senior guidance. And ultimately, this is how I wish my career to move forward: continual learning and growth to excel in development and research.
