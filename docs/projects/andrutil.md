AndrUtil
=====

This is a general-use library of functions I commonly find useful when developing my projects. The flavor of each type of function is broken into one of several categories.

- ML
  - reading
  - preprocessing
  - training
  - evaluation
- Multiprocessing
- Design patterns
  - Watchdog
  - Observer/Observable
- Miscellaneous functional
