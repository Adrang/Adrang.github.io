AutoDrone
=====

This project was originally undertaken to fulfill the requirements for a graduate level independent study towards the completion of the Master's of Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology.

The ultimate goal pursued during this project was two-fold: to explore machine learning and control systems on a resource-constrained system and to offer practical experience into the design decisions required for building such a system. An additional benefit is the end-creation of a computer controlled drone which can be readily extended for control by other control mechanisms, such as BCIs or VR headsets.
