# [System Control](systemcontrol.md)

github logo and link

The original intent had been to create and explore a system that allowed a person to use their mind to control a character in a simple 3d environment. I had played WoW with some regularity through middle school and parts of high school, and the company my mom worked for (eXp) had all their offices in a virtual, online environment. An effective brain-controlled interface seemed to be the best option for an intuitive control interface. Current methods tend to be anything but intuitive, however. Turn left by focusing more and turn right by calming your mind? You may be able to train your mind to perform those tasks on demand, but that is anything but intuitive.
