## Theme documentation

This website uses the [Hacker](https://jekyll-themes.com/pages-themes/hacker) theme provided as an option through github pages.

### Learn More

[This resource](https://jekyll-themes.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) uses the same theme to build a minimalist responsive site. They also go over more specifics regarding building the theme from source to not rely on pointing directly to the remote theme.

[This source]((https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html)) is in reference to a different theme (Documentation Theme), but it is very thorough and is a decent resource for generally learning more about jekyll themes from a practical perspective.
