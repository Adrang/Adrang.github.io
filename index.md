A place all for me to just ramble and rant. And you've come across this place. How unfortunate of you.

# Latest Projects

## [AutoDrone](https://github.com/Adrang/AutoDrone)

The newest changes to my autonomous drone project is an replacing the flight controller stack with an RL-based, on-board flight controller. A pretrained agent is trained in AirSim to get a basic handle on controlling the motors. The agent is then transported to the RPi and continues training in the real-world.

## [SystemControl](https://github.com/Adrang/SystemControl)

A release has been created for the code related to my thesis. This release is linked to at the top of the readme. Work moving forward for this project is currently exploring the options outlined in the `Future Works` section towards the end of the thesis. 

## [Andrutil](https://github.com/Adrang/Andrutil)

The listener capabilities have been moved into a single module. Callback functions can now define an abstract signature taking a single argument that contains a dictionary of values. This allows for easier implementation of callbacks since all callback signatures are standardized.
