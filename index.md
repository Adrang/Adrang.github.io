[//]: # (I've been thinking further on our conversation from the other day and talking it through with some of my labmates from before. Gaurav pointed out that I'm most devoted when I'm solving a problem, and more importantly, building *something*.I think that's the direction I want to move at least in the immediate future, especially concerning cultivating relevant skillsets. Part of this is the &#40;software&#41; engineering processes, but also a full product/company/idea. Even thinking back to our time at IOMAXIS, the small contracts we started to tackle towards the end were less fulfilling and evoed less commitment. But when we were working on our projects that we wanted to make something out of, those were the type of projects I wanted to pursue; how to turn a grand idea into a realized implementation. )

[//]: # (Towards that end, I think for the next while, I want to find something that either guides me, or allows me to learn, what it takes to build something that is mine and that I am proud of, beyond just small scale projects or one-offs. Even while with Dr. Tumer, the papers and projects I'd pitch would always be backed by a larger idea of where I wanted to go with it the the eventual future &#40;though scoping wasn't always consistent and not always part of the pitch&#41;,)

[//]: # (## Outlier)

## Oregon State University

At Oregon State University, I conducted cutting-edge research in multiagent learning and environmental dynamics, leading to published papers with significant performance improvements. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I automated grading systems, reducing workload by over 85\%, and developed comprehensive teaching plans for software architecture and algorithm design.

## IOMAXIS

While with IOMAXIS, I led advanced machine learning and data science projects, including developing high-accuracy landmark recognition, enhancing proposal targeting using LLMs, and researching audio separation techniques. Additionally, I implemented a decentralized data capture system with software-defined networking for improved security and efficiency.

## UTC Aerospace

At UTC Aerospace Systems, I enhanced system compliance and reliability through test harness design, automated reporting, and thorough code reviews, contributing to improved project quality and adherence to FAA regulations.

## Sophos

At Sophos, I automated the discovery of OSINT assets and conducted vulnerability assessments using Java and Burp Suite, improving detection efficiency and aiding in the remediation of security threats.
