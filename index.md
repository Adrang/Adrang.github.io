I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher with a passion for solving problems and building innovative solutions. My commitment to my work is strongest when I am engaged in projects that involve creating and realizing impactful ideas. Reflecting on my experiences, especially those at IOMAXIS, I find the most fulfillment in developing full-scale products and solutions rather than smaller, less integrated tasks.

In the near future, I am seeking opportunities that allow me to expand my skill set in both the engineering processes and the holistic development of products or ideas. My goal is to contribute to and learn from projects that have the potential to grow into something significant and lasting. I aspire to build and be proud of something that extends beyond small-scale initiatives, grounded in a vision for the future.

If you have grand ideas, let me be the developer that helps you bring them into the tangible, lasting solutions. I am eager to engage in opportunities that allow for me to contribute and scale challenging, meaningful projects.

Gaurav pointed out that I'm most devoted when I'm solving a problem, and more importantly, building *something*.I think that's the direction I want to move at least in the immediate future, especially concerning cultivating relevant skillsets. Part of this is the &#40;software&#41; engineering processes, but also a full product/company/idea. Even thinking back to our time at IOMAXIS, the small contracts we started to tackle towards the end were less fulfilling and evoed less commitment. But when we were working on our projects that we wanted to make something out of, those were the type of projects I wanted to pursue; how to turn a grand idea into a realized implementation. )

Even while with Dr. Tumer, the papers and projects I'd pitch would always be backed by a larger idea of where I wanted to go with it the eventual future &#40;though scoping wasn't always consistent and not always part of the pitch&#41;.)

## Outlier

Provided training and feedback for LLMs on a variety of code, math, and reasoning tasks to guide them towards greater capabilities in these domains.

## Oregon State University

At Oregon State University, I conducted cutting-edge research in multiagent learning and environmental dynamics, leading to published papers with significant performance improvements. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I automated grading systems, reducing workload by over 85\%, and developed comprehensive teaching plans for software architecture and algorithm design.

## IOMAXIS

While with IOMAXIS, I led advanced machine learning and data science projects, including developing high-accuracy landmark recognition, enhancing proposal targeting using LLMs, and researching audio separation techniques. Additionally, I implemented a decentralized data capture system with software-defined networking for improved security and efficiency.

## UTC Aerospace

At UTC Aerospace Systems, I enhanced system compliance and reliability through test harness design, automated reporting, and thorough code reviews, contributing to improved project quality and adherence to FAA regulations.

## Sophos

At Sophos, I automated the discovery of OSINT assets and conducted vulnerability assessments using Java and Burp Suite, improving detection efficiency and aiding in the remediation of security threats.
