# Bio

I grew up in West Hartford, CT and went to Conard High School where I was able to take classes, and later work with, [Jackie Corricelli](https://sites.google.com/whps.org/corricelli). I attribute a large portion of my interest in Computer Science to her and her dedication to teaching. She also played a pivotal role in my Eagle project, helping to coordinate communication between Smith Elementary School and Conard for fostering an interest in 4th and 5th grade students in learning coding.

Starting in August 2015, I attended [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) for Computer science and shortly added electrical engineering as a double major. I started in the BS/MS program in August 2018 and graduated Magna Cum Laude with honors in May 2020.

# Research Interests

Broadly speaking, my interest is in understanding and interacting with the world in which we live. Specifically, my interests focus on the following topics:

- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Multi-agent systems
- Human-Computer Interaction/Animal-Computer Interaction
