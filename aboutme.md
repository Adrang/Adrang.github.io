# Bio

I grew up in West Hartford, CT and went to Conard High School where I was able to take classes, and later work with, [Jackie Corricelli](https://sites.google.com/whps.org/corricelli). I attribute a large portion of my interest in Computer Science to her and her dedication to teaching. She also played a pivotal role in my Eagle project, helping to coordinate communication between Smith Elementary School and Conard for facilitating an interest in learning coding from a young age.

Starting in August 2015, I attended [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) for Computer science and shortly added electrical engineering as a double major. I started in the BS/MS program in August 2018 and graduated Cum Laude in May 2020.

# Research Interests

Broadly speaking, my interest is in understanding and interacting with the world in which we live.

- AI/ML
- Multi-agent systems
- HCI/ACI
